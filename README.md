### Best Grass Cutting Patterns for Various Lawn Shapes and Sizes

#

1. Rectangular/Square Lawns:
   
Small to Medium Size:

- Straight Lines: Mow back and forth in straight lines parallel to the longest side.
- Striping: Mow in alternate directions with each pass to create a striped appearance.
       
Large Size:

- Striping: Similar to smaller lawns but may require more precise turning at ends.
- Checkered: Mow in one direction (e.g., north-south), then mow perpendicularly (e.g., east-west) on the next session.

#

2. Circular or Irregular Lawns:
   
Small to Medium Size:

Spiral: Start from the outside edge and mow in a tight spiral towards the center.

Large Size:

Spiral: Begin with wider arcs and progressively tighten the spiral as you move inward.
Large circles to smaller spirals: Start with large circular patterns, transitioning to smaller, tighter spirals.

#

3. Narrow or Long Lawns:

All Sizes:

Straight Lines: Mow in long, straight lines along the length of the lawn to minimize turning.

#

4. Complex Shaped Lawns (with multiple flower beds or obstacles):

All Sizes:

Sectional Mowing: Divide the lawn into manageable sections and mow each using the best pattern for its shape.

### Optimal General Pattern for All Lawns

Alternating Striping:

- Description: Alternating the mowing direction with each mow to promote even grass growth and reduce soil compaction. Suitable for most lawn shapes and sizes, and enhances aesthetic appeal through a professional, striped look.
